## About
This is a lottery game where the players buy boxes.
The winner receives 10% of ALL the boxes sold.
The admin creates a number of boxes, each box has a list of random items. Item's attributes are Name, Image, Description and Price.
All items prices in the box summed up plus 10% equal the price of the box.
Example of Items: Voucher worth 0.0096 ETH, iPhone worth 0.000048 ETH, A laptop worth 2.39 ETH, etc.
Example of a box: Voucher worth 0.0016 ETH, a mobile worth 0.000064 ETH
This Box is sold for 0.0096 + 0.000064 + 10% (0.0009664) = 0.0106304 ETH
The box's ownership acts like a smart contract. The ownership is the admin's until any user buys it, The ownership is transferred to the user.
Players can register using First Name, Last Name, Mobile number, Email and Gender.
Players can only buy the boxes using Ethereum.
The admin clicks a button which randomly chooses one of the people who bought a box. The winner's money is calculated automatically.
